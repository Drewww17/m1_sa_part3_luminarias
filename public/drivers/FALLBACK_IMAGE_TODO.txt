TODO: Add fallback.webp image for drivers without photos

This placeholder file indicates that a fallback.webp image should be placed in this directory.
The image will be used when a driver's photo is not available in the system.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: WebP
- Dimensions: 128x128 pixels or similar square format
- Content: Generic F1 driver silhouette or placeholder icon
- File name: fallback.webp

Until the actual image is added, the application will reference /drivers/fallback.webp
and may show a broken image icon or use the component's fallback rendering logic.
